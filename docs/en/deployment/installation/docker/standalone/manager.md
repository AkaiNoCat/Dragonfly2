## Procedure - When Deploying with Docker

### Get manager image

You can get it from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) directly.

1. Obtain the latest Docker image of the manager.

    ```sh
    docker pull d7yio/manager
    ```

Or you can build your own manager image.

1. Obtain the source code of Dragonfly.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2.git
    ```

2. Enter the project directory.

    ```sh
    cd Dragonfly2
    ```

3. Build the Docker image.

    ```sh
    TAG="2.0.0"
    make docker-build-manager D7Y_VERSION=$TAG
    ```

4. Obtain the latest Docker image ID of the manager.

    ```sh
    docker image ls | grep 'manager' | awk '{print $3}' | head -n1
    ```

### Start manager

**NOTE:** Replace ${managerDockerImageId} with the ID obtained at the previous step.

```sh
docker run -d --name manager --restart=always -p 8080:8080 -p 65003:65003 ${managerDockerImageId}
```

After manager is installed, run the following commands to
verify if **manager** is started, and if Port `8080` and `65003` is available.

```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
telnet 127.0.0.1 65003
```

### Manager console
