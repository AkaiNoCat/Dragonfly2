# You can configure your scheduler by change the parameter according your requirement.

# scheduler policy configuration
scheduler:
  # algorithm configuration to use different scheduling algorithms,
  # default configuration supports "default" and "ml"
  # "default" is the rule-based scheduling algorithm, "ml" is the machine learning scheduling algorithm
  # It also supports user plugin extension, the algorithm value is "plugin",
  # and the compiled `d7y-scheduler-plugin-evaluator.so` file is added to
  # the dragonfly working directory plugins
  algorithm: default
  # workerNum is the number of goroutines that perform scheduling tasks
  # default:
  workerNum: 12
  # backSourceCount is the number of back-to-origin clients when the CDN is disable or unavailable
  # default: 3
  backSourceCount: 3
  # accessWindow is access interval window that can trigger CDN back to the source again
  # default: 3m
