NAME
====

**dfget** â€” client of Dragonfly used to download and upload files

SYNOPSIS
========

dfget is the client of Dragonfly which takes a role of peer in a P2P network. When user triggers a file downloading
task, dfget will download the pieces of file from other peers. Meanwhile, it will act as an uploader to support other
peers to download pieces from it if it owns them. In addition, dfget has the abilities to provide more advanced
functionality, such as network bandwidth limit, transmission encryption and so on.

-n, --node

:   deprecated, please use schedulers instead. specify the addresses(host:port=weight) of supernodes where the host is necessary, the port(default: 8002) and the weight(default:1) are optional. And the type of weight must be integer

--notbacksource

:   disable back source downloading for requested file when p2p fails to download it

-o, --output
